If you want to add Google Analytics (gtag.js) tracking to only a specific page within your Vue.js project, you can conditionally load and use the `vue-gtag` plugin on that page while keeping it disabled on other pages. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install the `vue-gtag` Package:**
   If you haven't already, install the `vue-gtag` package as described in the previous response.

2. **Conditional Loading of `vue-gtag`:**
   In the main Vue application file (usually `main.js`), you can conditionally load the `vue-gtag` plugin based on the specific page where you want to enable Google Analytics tracking.

   ```javascript
   import Vue from "vue";
   import App from "./App.vue";
   import VueGtag from "vue-gtag";

   Vue.config.productionTip = false;

   // Check if the current route matches the specific page where you want to enable tracking
   const enableTracking = window.location.pathname === "/specific-page"; // Adjust the path

   if (enableTracking) {
     Vue.use(VueGtag, {
       config: { id: "YOUR-GA-TRACKING-ID" },
     });
   }

   new Vue({
     render: (h) => h(App),
   }).$mount("#app");
   ```

3. **Use `gtag` in Your Components:**
   In the components of the specific page, you can use the `$gtag` object to send tracking events, as shown in the previous response.

By conditionally loading the `vue-gtag` plugin only on the specific page where you want to enable tracking, you can ensure that Google Analytics tracking is active only for that page while keeping it disabled on other pages of your Vue.js project.
